# Manufacturing-Analytics-Project-Excel-SQL-Tableau-Power-BI-
Manufacturing Analytics Project using Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI to analyze production performance, quality metrics, machine costs, and buyer contribution. Interactive dashboards provide insights into efficiency, rejection trends, cost optimization, and operational decision-making.

## Implementation Blueprint
  * 🧹 Data Acquisition & Preparation:
Collected and consolidated manufacturing transactional data covering production quantities, rejected quantities, machine costs, operations, departments, buyers, employees, and time periods. The dataset was cleaned and standardized using Excel and SQL to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and ensure accurate KPI calculations across tools.
* 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Performed in-depth analysis to identify production trends, rejection patterns, cost drivers, and buyer performance. EDA helped uncover seasonal production variations, high-rejection operations, cost-intensive machines, and differences in buyer contribution and fulfillment performance.
* 📊 Interactive Dashboard Development:
Developed interactive dashboards in Excel, Tableau, and Power BI featuring slicers, filters, and drill-down capabilities by buyer, department, operation, machine, employee, and time period. These dashboards enable users to dynamically explore manufacturing performance from both operational and executive perspectives.
* 📈 Performance & Efficiency Metrics:
Calculated key manufacturing KPIs including production completion percentage, rejection rate, defect rate, first pass yield (FPY), cost per unit, cost efficiency, machine productivity, on-time delivery, and customer fulfillment rate to evaluate overall operational effectiveness.
* 🤖 Operational & Predictive Insights:
Analyzed historical production and cost trends to identify performance bottlenecks and improvement opportunities. The insights highlight areas where process optimization, machine efficiency improvements, and quality control measures can enhance productivity and reduce operational costs.
* 🌍 Real-World Manufacturing Applications:
Demonstrates how manufacturing organizations can monitor production efficiency, control quality losses, optimize machine utilization, manage buyer demand, and improve profitability through data-driven decision-making and business intelligence tools.
